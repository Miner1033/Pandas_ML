# 📊 Pandas Data Analysis Project

This repository contains data analysis projects using **Pandas**, a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python.

## 📚 Overview

Pandas provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python programming. This repository demonstrates how to use **Pandas** for tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization.

## ✨ Features

- 📥 Loading and saving data from various sources (CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.)
- 🧹 Data cleaning and transformation
- 🔢 Aggregation and grouping data
- 🔗 Merging and joining datasets
- 📈 Data visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib
- ⏳ Time series analysis

## 🚀 Installation

To run this project locally, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pandas-data-analysis.git
   cd pandas-data-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
💻 Usage
Here’s an example of using Pandas to load a CSV file and perform some basic analysis:
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Show the first 5 rows of the dataset
print(df.head())

# Basic data analysis
print(df.describe())

# Grouping data by a column and calculating the mean
grouped_data = df.groupby('column_name').mean()
print(grouped_data)
